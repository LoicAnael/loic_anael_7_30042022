## projet P7 - Parcours Front-end

## Démarrer le projet les Petits Plats

After publishing cookbooks for several years, the company decided to embark on a new project: to create its own site of cooking recipes like Marmiton or 750g.

Sandra, project manager, is in charge of the digitalization of the company with the creation of this website. For now, she only works with freelancers, before creating an internal team to manage this project. In this folder you will find a file named "Cas+d’utilisation+Filtrer+les+recettes+dans+l’interface+utilisateur" which is the description of the search use case. It is this document that served as a reference for all the development of this feature.
